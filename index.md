### CPSC 120

* [Lab 7](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-07-sophia-josh-and-wilson)

Lab 7, part 2 has inspired me heavily when learning computer science. The reasons why I find such heavy inspiration from this assignment was because of how we were able to apply functions as well as giving definitions to something like a deck of cards. It was very interesting to see how the function ran and computed the possibilites and combinations of the card to give us the outcome of the hand.

* [Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-08-wilson-n-josh-a-and-sophia-l)

Lab 8, part 3 was one of my more memorable lab because it was one of the shortest code I created with my lab partners, but even so it required critical thinking. We figured that we had to use ifstream statements to allow the program to run all together, but it stumped me for quite awhile. I like this code more than the other ones I have done in my computer science class because of the critical thinking it required.

* [Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-12-wilson-n-timothy-k-angel-c)

Lab 12, part 1 has been my most favorite lab that I have done so far because with just programing alone, I was able to generate my first animation. With the help of attached files to the program, it helped me generate an animation that looped perfectly and was able to run smoothly. It inspired me the most because it showed the the many potentials that computer science has and how much it can create.
